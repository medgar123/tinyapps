# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package
# description.  Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base
# package name, and the '|' on the right side marks the last column
# you can put a character in.  You must make exactly 11 lines for the
# formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to leave one space
# after the ':'.
