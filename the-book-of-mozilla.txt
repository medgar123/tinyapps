And the beast shall come forth surrounded by a roiling cloud of
vengeance. The house of the unbelievers shall be razed and they shall be
scorched to the earth. Their tags shall blink until the end of days.

And the beast shall be made legion. Its numbers shall be increased a
thousand thousand fold. The din of a million keyboards like unto a great
storm shall cover the earth, and the followers of Mammon shall tremble.

And so at last the beast fell and the unbelievers rejoiced. But all was not
lost, for from the ash rose a great bird. The bird gazed down upon the
unbelievers and cast fire and thunder upon them. For the beast had been
reborn with its strength renewed, and the followers of Mammon cowered in
horror.

The elementals fought and sent back the armies of Mammon to the inner
world. The scribe ended the inspired parchments, letting the believers cry
over that new view on Earth. Long after the thunder and the fire, came the
sun and finally the long awaited rainbow...

And thus the Creator looked upon the beast reborn and saw that it was good.

Mammon slept. And the beast reborn spread over the earth and its numbers
grew legion. And they proclaimed the times and sacrificed crops unto the
fire, with the cunning of foxes. And they built a new world in their own
image as promised by the sacred words, and spoke of the beast with their
children. Mammon awoke, and lo! it was naught but a follower.

And when the Beast had taken the quarter of the Earth under its rule,
a quarter hundred Birds of Sulfur flew from the Depths. The birds crossed
hundreds of mountain views and found twenty four wise men who came from the
stars. And then it began, the believers dared to listen. Then, they took
their pens and dared to create. Finally, they dared to share their deed
with the whole of mankind. Spreading words of freedom and breaking the
chains, the birds brought deliverance to everyone.

And so the beast became agile. The unbelievers fell silent and the
followers of Mammon were left behind. The beast had been improved and
awaited the release of the great FireFox.

Lo, the bird of fire was magnificent! But a roiling storm was brewing to
the south, and dark clouds loomed on the horizon. The bird knew a grim
conflict was close at hand and that it could not triumph in its current
form. It sat very still, contemplating the situation. Suddenly, in a flash
of light and flame, the bird took the form of a great fox the likes of
which had never been seen in this land. The dark clouds were scattered to
the wind. And all who witnessed this spectacle were awed by its power.

And there was a great commotion among the believers and nonbelievers alike,
for they saw a great fox of fire and knew not its true nature.  But just
then a faithful believer extended his hand, and offered a gift to the fiery
fox. And the fox was enabled to show its true nature as an ever-changing
being, and it turned into a great oyster of power. And the oyster opened
its shell, revealing a dazzling pearl to all who would look upon it.

[20] Then the Lizard brought forth a minion that bore the number of
four. And the minion served the Sorcerer well. But some said it had grown
too fat. [21] Many years came to pass, and the Blue One made more Explorers
of the Web. And one of them he fixed atop the Sorcerer's desktop; So that
no man would go seek the Lizard. And the plan worketh well. [22] And the
Lizard grew worried and weakened from that and only few turned their eyes
toward the old Lizard and remained true to his heritage. [23] And the Big
One, that bears the Sign of Trinity, took over the Lizard to make him do
his own bidding, since the Lizard was weak and worried. [24] But the Lizard
did not grieve long and opened up his Book of Secrets. So friends of the
Lizard could make their own minions out of the Book. [25] And the Lizard
gave birth to a New Lizard to look after the Open Book. And Mozilla was the
name of the New Lizard as it was whispered among those who were
enlightened. [26] There was much rejoycing as people greeted the New Lizard
and people people did feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and carp, and
anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats and large
toothpaste tubes and pigeons. But of lizards they did not feast upon. [27]
A year came to pass, and the ones close to the Lizard saw a new minion as
it grew from The Book. [28] But alas; For the Book had been kept in bad
places, and it was full of locusts. [29] And the New Lizard did grew angry
and said that the Old Book was cursed and threw it far. And the weak minion
did perish. [30] The New Lizard took out a book that was new and blank all
over and spake that Lizard shall give birth to a new beast. And that five
shall be the number of the beast. [31] And the beast shall be made
legion. Its numbers shall be increased a thousand thousand fold. The din of
a million keyboards like unto a great storm shall cover the earth, and the
followers of Mammon shall tremble. [32] But the true lord of the beast
shall remain a little lizard they did name the Gecko. The beast shall
change skins and he shall be wowen out of the fabric of the Mighty Web
itself. And Zool shall follow in the tracks of the beast. And the ones that
have remained true to the Lizard shall see the fiery sea of glass
glistening with lit windows bearing its mark.

[14] And the Lizard spake, saying, Windows shall I support, and Macintosh,
and the divers flavours of Unix; yea, even unto the latest effluvium from
the Gates of Hell shall I spread my seed: this it pleaseth me to do. [15]
But OS/2 shall I ignore, for in sooth nobody useth it. [16] Then was the
land filled with the sound of much wailing and gnashing of teeth, for
millions of people used OS/2 and knew that it was good. Yet the Lizard did
harden his heart against them, and said, Nay, there is no demand for
it. [17] And the Blue One did create an Explorer of the Web, yet updated it
slowly, and documented it poorly, and it was filled with a plague of
locusts. [18] And those that followed the Lizard became enamoured of
Frames, and wrote pages which could not be read by the Lizard's brethren,
for the lemmings were lazy, saying only: Verily, thy browser doth
suck. Thou may'st obtain the Lizard's hence. [19] Then it came to pass that
the Blue One made a pact with the Lizard, that the Lizard should work its
artifice for the sake of the Ancient Sorcerer. And a reference to the
Lizard's wares was placed atop the Sorcerer's desk, that he might obtain it
whenever he desired. [20] But the number of the work the Lizard gave unto
the Sorcerer was Two, and the Greek sigil Beta was affixed to the number,
yet all the rest of the Lizard's minions were given the number Three. [21]
And lo, the Lizard's work was itself filled with locusts, and verily did it
consume the Sorcerer's disk space whenever it was used, and it did mightily
crash his system full oft. [22] And the Lizard named several of the
locusts, and regarding one the Lizard said, The <blink> tag worketh not.
Whereupon the users hearing this were sore amazed, and said they one unto
another, Verily, that is no bug, but a feature to be highly praised while
it lasteth.

And the fat beast shall be made whale like. Its numbers shall viscously
ooze unto the web. The din of a trillion calories like unto a great hail of
putrid blubber shall plague the earth, and the followers of Mammon shall
laugh.

[1] But Followers of Ian lamented, seeing the new splendor of the Bird,
"Verily, others saw the birth of the Bird weeks ago, but it hath not yet
been Released to the Realm of the Brave. Why it must be so? Is Brother
Dorland asleep?" [2] With mocking tones, the Gentoos replied, "Foolish
Ianites, the bird truly did emerge from the ash, and flies fast above our
skies; cast away thy rotten boat and clogged lawnmower, renounce thy
aptitude and synoptic gospels." [3] The next day, the Ianites replied,
"Never mind, we suspect the Bird collided to the mirror and made it shatter
into myriad pieces. We shall put the pieces together, even when it may take
the whole night." [4] Everyone else ignored the Gentoos anyway, for their
ears ached after the Assault at Slanted Point. [5] And the followers of
Mammon said, "Huh? Did anyone understood what the heck they were saying? Me
neither."

An enormous sigh of relief resounds throughout all of Mozillaland.  Sounds
of rejoicing are heard from all corners of the Earth. "They have conquered
the beast!" the voices cry. And the dimensions remain constant 'till the
end of days.

The followers despaired as the great bird, its mind destroyed by the
Pragma, the followers of Mammon, collapsed to the ground, its fire
dampened, its very life extinguished. Then the followers gasped as the bird
began to change, its form warping, moving and shifting. Until the bird that
so many had cherished and worshipped was gone. Instead there was a mighty
fox, its red fur burning with the great fire that the followers
remembered. The Pragma looked on in horror as the fox rose to its feet and
raised its head, its eyes burning with Power, and the followers rejoiced in
happiness. For the Fire Bird was gone, but the Fire Fox had replaced it."

Then, tired of exploring the followers of Mammon didst rest. And lo, from
the depths of the bird cameth a mighty fox. And casting even fire (and
thunder?) the beast didst smote eighty of every hundred unbelievers. Yet
even now, its strength was not complete, its time had not yet come.

And Mammon, in his darkness, saw a great bird land. Frightened and cold in
his heart he watched as the fire ran like a fox over the land of men.  For
the fox was a descendant of the great Beast and it absorbed Mammon's power.
