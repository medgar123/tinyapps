Tiny Applications Collection is a set of small programs, shell scripts
and other  things which may be  usefull in everyday life  ;) There are
only a  few tools at  the moment but  I hope to  add more in  the near
future.

If you have written utility which may be usefull for other and want to
share it  please email  me at mina86/AT/tlen.pl,  I'll be glad  to add
your utility to the collection.

At the moment the collection include:

 * add - adds specified text to each line from stdin

 * ai-pitr.pl - it's a joke really.  It's an AI which might be written
   by Pitr from UserFriendly - it is 6 lines of code and answers
   questions just like Pitr's AI.  For more see:
   http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19990602

 * ai-sid.pl - it's a joke as well.  It's an AI which might by written
   by Sid - it behaves like Sid's AI and is 8 lines of code.  Fore
   more see: http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20001014

 * cdiff (C and sed versions) - adds ANSI codes to the output of diff
   making it a bit more readable.  Both versions reads input from
   stdin and sends output with added ANSI codes to stdout.

 * check-connection.sh - checks whether specified host responds to
   PING and runs specified command if not.  May be used to automaticly
   shut down PC when connection is lost, try to reconnect or monitor
   some kind of server and send message to server's admin when
   server's down.

 * checkmail - checks whether mboxes given as arguments contain any
   urnead mail.

 * cpuload.sh - tiny script showing the cpuload.  May be useful for
   people interested in how it is calculated (see also traf.sh and load).

 * cutcom - removes C++ comments from stdin and outputs the result to
   stdout.

 * FvwmTransFocus - an FVWM module which changes windows' opacity
   depending on focus.  Whn window looses focus it becomes more
   transparent which looks "cool" ;) .

 * get_mks_vir_bases - Downlaods MKS-Vir virus database.  Simplified
   version of mksupdate shell script (from mks_vir antivirus).  It
   does only download up-to-date virus bases and nothing more.

 * infinite-logger - loggs every logged message including the messages
   logget by itself :]

 * installkernel - pretty complex script for installing the Linux
   kernel.  It makes a lot of aspects of upgrading the kernel
   automatic.

 * load - shows CPU load, memory and net traffic statistics.  It's
   mostly ment for people who are curious how to callculate such
   statistics or use some code from the file in their programs.

 * malloc -  a small program  which allocates memory.   Sounds stupid?
   Mayby,  but in  theory it  can  help freeing  memory and  therefore
   speeding up the PC.

 * moz2elinks.pl - converts bookmarks from Mozilla's format to ELinks'
   (http://elinks.or.cz) format.

 * mpd-state - a program based on Avuton Olrich's state-utils for
   saving and restoring MPD (Music Player Daemon) state.  It requires
   libmpdclient.h and libmpdclient.c files to compile.

 * mpd-state-wrapper.sh - a small shell script making mpd-state
   behaving like Avuton Olrich's state-utils.

 * null - a C program (null.c) and a shell script (null.sh) which
   distard standard input.  It is ment for people who thnik that
   '>/dev/null' is too long to type every time :)

 * quotes.txt - a collection of quotations, some are in Polish.

 * rot13 - Performs an ROT13 'encryption' on stdin.

 * settitle - Sets the title of xterm, rxvt, Eterm, aterm and other
   xterm-compatible terminals.

 * the-book-of-mozilla - a collection of quotations from The Book of
   Mozilla.

 * timer - a timer.

 * traf.sh - tiny script showing traffic statistics.  Many things are
   hardcoded in the source but it may be useful for future
   modifications or to lear how traffic is calculated (see also
   cpuload.sh and load).

 * tuptime  - my  personal favourite  :)  Displays total  (sum of  all
   uptimes) and biggest uptime.

 * xcolor2rgb - Reads from argument list (or from STDIN, if no
   arguments are given) and prints apropriate RGB value to STDOUT.

More  documentation about  each  utility is  usually  provided in  the
source  code  or  utility's   README  file  which  is  usually  called
README.<utility-name>.
