Tiny Applications Collection is a set of small programs, shell scripts
and other  things which may be  usefull in everyday life  ;) There are
only a  few tools at  the moment but  I hope to  add more in  the near
future.

If you have written utility which may be usefull for other and want to
share it  please email me at  mn86/AT/o2.pl, I'll be glad  to add your
utility to the collection.

At the moment the collection include:

 * malloc -  a small program  which allocates memory.   Sounds stupid?
   Mayby,  but in  theory it  can  help freeing  memory and  therefore
   speeding up the PC.

 * quotes.txt - a collection of quotations, some are in Polish.

 * the-book-of-mozilla - a collection of quotations from The Book of
   Mozilla.

 * tuptime  - my  personal favourite  :)  Displays total  (sum of  all
   uptimes) and biggest uptime.

More  documentation about  each  utility is  usually  provided in  the
source  code  or  utility's   README  file  which  is  usually  called
README.<utility-name>.
