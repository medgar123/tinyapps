Tiny Applications Collection is a set of small programs, shell scripts
and other  things which may be  usefull in everyday life  ;) There are
only a  few tools at  the moment but  I hope to  add more in  the near
future.

If you have written utility which may be usefull for other and want to
share it  please email me at  mn86/AT/o2.pl, I'll be glad  to add your
utility to the collection.

At the moment the collection include:

 * FvwmTransFocus - an FVWM module which changes windows' opacity
   depending on focus.  Whn window looses focus it becomes more
   transparent which looks "cool" ;) .

 * cdiff (C and sed versions) - adds ANSI codes to the output of diff
   making it a bit more readable.  Both versions reads input from
   stdin and sends output with added ANSI codes to stdout.

 * load - shows CPU load, memory and net traffic statistics.  It's
   mostly ment for people who are curious how to callculate such
   statistics or use some code from the file in their programs.

 * malloc -  a small program  which allocates memory.   Sounds stupid?
   Mayby,  but in  theory it  can  help freeing  memory and  therefore
   speeding up the PC.

 * quotes.txt - a collection of quotations, some are in Polish.

 * timer - a timer.

 * the-book-of-mozilla - a collection of quotations from The Book of
   Mozilla.

 * tuptime  - my  personal favourite  :)  Displays total  (sum of  all
   uptimes) and biggest uptime.

More  documentation about  each  utility is  usually  provided in  the
source  code  or  utility's   README  file  which  is  usually  called
README.<utility-name>.
