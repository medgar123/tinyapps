Tiny Applications Collection is a set of small programs, shell scripts
and other  things which  may be usefull  in everyday life.   There are
only a few tools  at the moment but more are hoped  to be added in the
near future.

If you have  written utility which may be usefull  for others and want
to share it please email me  at mina86/AT/tlen.pl, I'll be glad to add
your utility to the collection.

At the moment the collection includes:

 * add - adds specified text to each line from stdin;

 * ai-pitr.pl - it's  a joke really.  A 6 line long  AI which might be
   written    by   Pitr    from   UserFriendly.     For    more   see:
   http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19990602 ;

 * ai-sid.pl - it's a joke as well.   An 8 line long AI which might by
   written    by   Sid    from   UserFriendly.     Fore    more   see:
   http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20001014 ;

 * cdiff (C and sed versions) -  adds ANSI codes to the output of diff
   making it a bit more readable.  Both versions read input from stdin
   and send colorized output to stdout;

 * check.sh  -  performes a  defined  checking (whether  www.googl.com
   responds to pings by default) and runs specified command if failed.
   May be  used to automaticly shut  down PC when  connection is lost,
   try to reconnect, monitor a server machine and send message to it's
   admin if it's down or keep given application running;

 * checkmail -  checks whether mboxes  given as arguments  contain any
   urnead mail;

 * cpuload.sh -  tiny script showing  the cpuload.  May be  useful for
   people  interested in  how  it  is calculated  (see  also load  and
   traf.sh);

 * cutcom - removes C++ comments  from stdin and outputs the result to
   stdout;

 * drun - it's really 'null' with aditional ability to daemonize
   (hence the name).  Helpful when running X applications from a
   terminal.

 * extractlinks.pl  - extracts links  from a  HTML page.   Useful, for
   example, when downloading an Internet gallery;

 * FvwmTransFocus  - an  FVWM  module which  changes windows'  opacity
   depending  on  focus.  Whn  window  looses  focus  it becomes  more
   transparent which looks "neet";

 * genpass.sh - generates a random 64-character long password;

 * get_mks_vir_bases -  downlaods MKS-Vir virus  database.  Simplified
   version  of mksupdate  shell script  (from mks_vir  antivirus).  It
   does only download up-to-date virus bases and nothing more;

 * getlyrics.pl - downloads  lyrics of a given song  from the Internet
   (http://www.lyrc.com.ar/ accauly);

 * gz2bz - a shell script using gzip and bzip2 to convert gzip
   compressed files to bzip2 compressed files.

 * infinite-logger - loggs every logged message including the messages
   logget by itself :]

 * installkernel  - pretty  complex  script for  installing the  Linux
   kernel.   It  makes  a  lot  of aspects  of  upgrading  the  kernel
   automatic.  The first versions required bash to run but the now, it
   is believed  to run on any  POSIX compatible platform so  it can be
   run even on small embeded systems;

 * load -  shows CPU  load, memory and  net traffic  statistics.  It's
   mostly  ment for  people who  are  curious how  to callculate  such
   statistics and use  some code from the file  in their programs (see
   also cpuload.sh and traf.sh);

 * malloc -  a small program  which allocates memory.   Sounds stupid?
   Mayby, but in theory it can help freeing RAM and therefore speeding
   up the PC;

 * mountiso  - a simple  mount/umount wrapper  for mounting/unmounting
   ISO images  or any other files  using loop option.  You  have to be
   root to use '-o loop' so if you want to mount an ISO image you have
   to login as  root.  This utility should be  SUIDed and then anyoune
   can use it to mount ISO images;

 * moz2elinks.pl  -  converts  bookmarks  from  Mozilla's  to  ELinks'
   (http://elinks.or.cz) format;

 * mp3rip - a command line utility for ripping tracks from CD Audio.
   It uses cdparanoia to rip the tracks and lame to encode them to
   MP3s.

 * mpd-show - tool  ment to display song currently  played in MPD.  It
   displays it  in a terminal  in one line with  background indicating
   the progress.  It  requires libmpdclient.h and libmpdclient.c files
   to compile;

 * mpd-state  - a  program based  on Avuton  Olrich's  state-utils for
   saving and restoring MPD  (Music Player Daemon) state.  It requires
   libmpdclient.h and libmpdclient.c files to compile;

 * mpd-state-wrapper.sh  -  a  small  shell  script  making  mpd-state
   behaving like Avuton Olrich's state-utils.

 * null  - a C  program (null.c)  and a  shell script  (null.sh) which
   discard  standard input.   It is  ment  for people  who thnik  that
   '>/dev/null' is too  long to type every time :) It  may also be run
   with arguments  and the given program  will be run  and both stdout
   and stderr will be redirected to /dev/null;

 * one-time-pass.sh -  another joke.  It  works like passwd  with this
   difference that it automaticly generates a random password which is
   not  revelad  to  the  user,  therefore he  doesn't  know  his  own
   password;

 * pingrange.pl - pings a range of adresses;

 * quotes.txt - a collection of quotations (some are in Polish);

 * rot13 - performs an ROT13 'encryption' on stdin;

 * settitle -  Sets the title of  xterm, rxvt, Eterm,  aterm and other
   xterm-compatible terminals;

 * the-book-of-mozilla -  a collection of quotations from  The Book of
   Mozilla (most are unofficial);

 * timer - a text-mdoe timer counting with accuracy to 0.01 s;

 * tpwd -  truncates PWD  to specified number  of characters.   May be
   used in PS1  to display only the  end of the PWD instead  of a full
   60-character long PWD which doesn't really look nice;

 * traf.sh - tiny script  showing traffic statistics.  Many things are
   hardcoded  in  the   source  but  it  may  be   useful  for  future
   modifications  or to  learn  how traffic  is  calculated (see  also
   cpuload.sh and load);

 * tuptime  - my  personal favourite  :)  Displays total  (sum of  all
   uptimes)  and biggest  uptime.   Might be  used  as replacement  to
   standard uptime utility;

 * xcolor2rgb  -  reads from  argument  list  (or  from STDIN,  if  no
   arguments are given) and prints apropriate RGB value to STDOUT.

 * xgetclass - prints window's application name and class as returned
   by XGetClassHint.  May be used in some kind of shell scripts but
   honestly I just wrote it to test XGetClassHint function and since I
   did it I decided to include it in tinyapps :)

More  documentation about  each  utility is  usually  provided in  the
source  code  or  utility's   README  file  which  is  usually  called
README.<utility-name>.
